# Demand Forecast and Analysis for California ISO

This repository contains a demand forecast and analysis project for the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). The project leverages time series analysis techniques and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to predict energy demand and optimize energy management within the CAISO grid.

## About

The demand forecast and analysis project aims to provide accurate predictions of energy demand within the CAISO grid, enabling efficient energy management and resource allocation. By leveraging time series analysis and LSTM models, the project helps in optimizing energy generation, transmission, and distribution operations.

## Features

1. **Demand Forecasting:** Utilize historical energy demand data to forecast future demand patterns within the CAISO grid. The forecasts are generated at various temporal granularities, such as hourly, daily, or monthly, to accommodate different planning horizons.

2. **LSTM Model:** Implement LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network models to capture complex temporal dependencies and patterns in energy demand data. The LSTM models offer improved accuracy compared to traditional time series forecasting methods.

3. **Optimization Model:** Develop an optimization model that utilizes the demand forecasts to optimize energy management strategies. This includes scheduling energy generation, transmission, and storage resources to meet demand while minimizing costs and maximizing reliability.

4. **Visualization and Analysis:** Provide interactive visualizations and analysis tools to explore historical demand data, view forecasted demand trends, and evaluate the performance of the demand forecasting and optimization models.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core logic of the project is implemented in Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language.
- **Time Series Analysis Libraries:** Utilize libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Statsmodels for time series data preprocessing, analysis, and forecasting.
- **Deep Learning Framework:** Implement LSTM models using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to capture complex temporal patterns in energy demand data.
- **Optimization Libraries:** Use optimization libraries such as SciPy or PuLP to develop and solve the energy management optimization model.
- **Visualization Tools:** Utilize libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
